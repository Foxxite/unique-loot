### Each chest that has a loot table creates a unique inventory for each player who opens it!

The race to be the first to discover structures is over, and you'll never open a loot chest to find someone's left-over trash again. You and your friends can explore structures together without worrying about who gets the loot. Rather than generating new ones, Unique Loot encourages players to explore existing structures, which reduces the size of the world.

This plugin generates random loot for each player who opens a chest or barrel that has a loot table. The loot is generated at random for each player. You cannot interact with loot chests using hoppers or break them unless you are in Creative Mode.
