### Each chest that has a loot table creates a unique inventory for each player who opens it!
The race to be the first to discover structures is over, and you'll never open a loot chest to find someone's left-over trash again. Most importantly, this plugin encourages players to explore existing structures rather than generating new ones, thus reducing the size of the world! Transform every structure into a trial chamber that you and your friends can explore together!

Please note that this plugin generates random loot for each player who opens a chest or barrel; the loot is different for each player. You cannot break or interact with loot chests using hoppers, unless you are in Creative Mode.
