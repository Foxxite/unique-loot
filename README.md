### Each chest that has a loot table creates a unique inventory for each player who opens it!
The race to be the first to discover structures is over, and you'll never open a loot chest to find someone's left-over trash again. Most importantly, this plugin encourages players to explore existing structures rather than generating new ones, thus reducing the size of the world! Transform every structure into a trial chamber that you and your friends can loot and explore together!

Please note that this plugin generates random loot for each player who opens a chest or barrel; the loot is different for each player. Chests and barrels containing loot can't be destroyed by explosions or interacted with with using hoppers, if the player isn't in Creative mode.
